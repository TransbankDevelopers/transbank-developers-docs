## Setting

This plugin has a configuration site that will allow you to enter credentials that Transbank will grant you and you will also be able to generate a diagnostic document in case Transbank requests it.

To access the configuration, you must follow the following steps:

1. Go to the VirtueMart administration page (usually at [http://mysite.com/administrator ](http://mysite.com/administrator), [http: // localhost / administrator] (http: // localhost / administrator)) and enter username and password.

2. Within the administration site go to (VirtueMart / Payment Methods).
