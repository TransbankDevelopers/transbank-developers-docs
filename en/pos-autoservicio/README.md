# Self-service POS

The Self-service solution is integrated into the kiosk of your business, with the particularity that it does not require intervention
of a clerk of your establishment, but allows the same customers to carry out the payment transaction of
complete and autonomous way. Ideal for businesses such as parking lots, gas stations and cinemas, among others.

## How does it work

The step by step for its implementation:

1. ** Technical feasibility audit **
It will establish if your business has the powers to carry out the technological development required by this
integration. In case of approval, you will be given a Technical Document with the instructions to follow.

2. **Development**
Your business must carry out the development according to the specifications that Transbank will give you.

3. **QA**
This process will verify that the integration development you did,
complies with those that we give you in the specifications, or if it requires any correction or improvement.

4. ** Pilot stage **
In a place that we agree on together, we take your self-service point of sale to production, where with real clients we will monitor its operation together, for a limited period of 2 weeks. We evaluate the results, and agree to overcrowding, also if any adjustment is required.

5. ** Massification **
We jointly build an installation plan for the points of sale.

 <aside class="notice">
For the development and testing of the business, Transbank delivers a set of tests to be executed and a set of physical cards for these cases, these cards only work in a development, certification or integration environment.

** Sales flow in self-service POS: **

1. The customer makes the selection of the product or service to buy
2. The customer selects the form of payment available at the kiosk, cash or credit card, debit card.
3. The kiosk invokes the POS, passing it the amount to be charged.
4. The customer operates a card, selects fees if applicable, and enters his pin.
5. The POS informs the kiosk the result of the sale (approved or rejected).
6. The kiosk releases the product and prints the receipts.
